# C â™­

Take C.
Remove header files.
Slap on generics(with interfaces), metaprogramming/reflection, tagged unions, modules, fat pointers (banish null terminated strings).
Sprinkle iterators.
Delete errno from existence: errors as values.
Make sure C ffi is still strong.
That should be pretty good!
